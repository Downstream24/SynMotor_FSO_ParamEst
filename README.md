# Synchronous Machine Model-based Sensorless Control with Full State Observer & Parameter Estimation
This repository demonstrates the model-based synchronous machine sensorless control with parameter estimation.

Thanks to [unified ac motor model based on active flux concept by Ion Boldea](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9853634/),
all AC machines can be simulated as unified control target(without extra signal excitation)



Both MATLABSimulink(MATLAB 2019B) and python files on full state observer with parameter estimation are given in this project.
