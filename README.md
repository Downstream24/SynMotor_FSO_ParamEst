# Synchronous Machine Model-based Sensorless Control with Full State Observer & Parameter Estimation
This repository demonstrates the model-based synchronous machine sensorless control with parameter estimation.
Thanks to [unified ac motor model based on active flux concept by Ion Boldea](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9853634/),
all AC machines can be simulated as unified control target(without extra signal excitation)

Both MATLAB-simulink and python based full state observer with parameter estimation are given in this project.
